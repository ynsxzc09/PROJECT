                    <p><b>The First Geisha were Men</b><br/>
                        Referred to as taikomochi and sometimes known as houkan- male geishas were jesters of sorts. It wasn’t until 25 years after their glory days that women- then known as geiko- “arts child”, outnumbered the working taikomochi. Geiko then transformed into geisha "person of the arts" as we know it today. Peek into the world of geishas in Gion, the centuries-old entertainment district of Kyoto.</p>
